<h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
<p>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and the resulting coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) have afflicted tens of millions of people in a worldwide pandemic. Safe and effective vaccines are needed urgently.
    placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, pivotal efficacy trial, we randomly assigned persons 16 years of age or older in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses, 21 days apart, of either placebo or the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate (30 μg per dose). BNT162b2 is a lipid nanoparticle–formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine that encodes a prefusion stabilized, membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full- length spike protein.
    There were 8 cases of Covid-19 with onset at least 7 days after the second dose among participants as- signed to receive BNT162b2 and 162 cases among those assigned to placebo; BNT162b2 was 95% effective in preventing Covid-19 (95% credible interval, 90.3 to 97.6). Similar vaccine efficacy (generally 90 to 100%) was observed across subgroups defined by age, sex, race, ethnicity, baseline body-mass index, and the presence of coexisting conditions. Among 10 cases of severe Covid-19 with onset after the first dose, 9 occurred in placebo recipients and 1 in a BNT162b2 recipient. The safety profile of BNT162b2 was characterized by short-term, mild-to-moderate pain at the injection site, fatigue, and headache.

<h1>METHODS</h1>
<p>In an ongoing multinational, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, pivotal efficacy trial, we randomly assigned persons 16 years of age or older in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses, 21 days apart, of either placebo or the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate (30 μg per dose). BNT162b2 is a lipid nanoparticle–formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine that encodes a prefusion stabilized, membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full- length spike protein.
    total of 43,548 participants underwent randomization, of whom 43,448 received injections: 21,720 with BNT162b2 and 21,728 with placebo. There were 8 cases of Covid-19 with onset at least 7 days after the second dose among participants as- signed to receive BNT162b2 and 162 cases among those assigned to placebo; BNT162b2 was 95% effective in preventing Covid-19 (95% credible interval, 90.3 to 97.6). Similar vaccine efficacy (generally 90 to 100%) was observed across subgroups defined by age, sex, race, ethnicity, baseline body-mass index, and the presence of coexisting conditions. Among 10 cases of severe Covid-19 with onset after the first dose, 9 occurred in placebo recipients and 1 in a BNT162b2 recipient. The safety profile of BNT162b2 was characterized by short-term, mild-to-moderate pain at the injection site, fatigue, and headache. The primary end points were efficacy of the vaccine against laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 and safety.</p>
<h1>RESULTS</h1>
<p>A total of 43,548 participants underwent randomization, of whom 43,448 received injections: 21,720 with BNT162b2 and 21,728 with placebo. There were 8 cases of Covid-19 with onset at least 7 days after the second dose among participants as- signed to receive BNT162b2 and 162 cases among those assigned to placebo; BNT162b2 was 95% effective in preventing Covid-19 (95% credible interval, 90.3 to 97.6). Similar vaccine efficacy (generally 90 to 100%) was observed across subgroups defined by age, sex, race, ethnicity, baseline body-mass index, and the presence of coexisting conditions. Among 10 cases of severe Covid-19 with onset after the first dose, 9 occurred in placebo recipients and 1 in a BNT162b2 recipient. The safety profile of BNT162b2 was characterized by short-term, mild-to-moderate pain at the injection site, fatigue, and headache. The incidence of serious adverse events was low and was similar in the vaccine and placebo groups.</p>
<h1>CONCLUSIONS</h1>
<p>A two-dose regimen of BNT162b2 conferred 95% protection against Covid-19 in persons 16 years of age or older. Safety over a median of 2 months was similar to that of other viral vaccines. (Funded by BioNTech and Pfizer; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04368728.)
    Findings from studies conducted in the United States and Germany among healthy men and women showed that two 30-μg doses of BNT162b2 elicited high SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers and robust antigen- specific CD8+ and Th1-type CD4+ T-cell respons- es.8 The 50% neutralizing geometric mean titers elicited by 30 μg of BNT162b2 in older and young- er adults exceeded the geometric mean titer mea- sured in a human convalescent serum panel, de- spite a lower neutralizing response in older adults than in younger adults. In addition, the reactoge- nicity profile of BNT162b2 represented mainly short-term local (i.e., injection site) and systemic responses. These findings supported progression of the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate into phase 3.
Here, we report safety and efficacy findings from the phase 2/3 part of a global phase 1/2/3 trial evaluating the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of 30 μg of BNT162b2 in preventing Covid-19 in persons 16 years of age or older. This data set and these trial results are the basis for an application for emergency use authorization.

<p>oronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has affected tens of millions of people globally1 since it was declared a pandemic</p>
<p>by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020.2 Older adults, persons with certain coex- isting conditions, and front-line workers are at highest risk for Covid-19 and its complications. Recent data show increasing rates of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and Covid-19 in other populations, in- cluding younger adults.3 Safe and effective pro- phylactic vaccines are urgently needed to contain the pandemic, which has had devastating medi- cal, economic, and social consequences.</p>
<p>We previously reported phase 1 safety and im- munogenicity results from clinical trials of the vaccine candidate BNT162b2,4 a lipid nanoparticle– formulated,5 nucleoside-modified RNA (modRNA)6 encoding the SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike, modi- fied by two proline mutations to lock it in the prefusion conformation.7 Findings from studies conducted in the United States and Germany among healthy men and women showed that two 30-μg doses of BNT162b2 elicited high SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers and robust antigen- specific CD8+ and Th1-type CD4+ T-cell respons- es.8 The 50% neutralizing geometric mean titers elicited by 30 μg of BNT162b2 in older and young- er adults exceeded the geometric mean titer mea- sured in a human convalescent serum panel, de- spite a lower neutralizing response in older adults than in younger adults. In addition, the reactoge- nicity profile of BNT162b2 represented mainly short-term local (i.e., injection site) and systemic responses. These findings supported progression of the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate into phase 3.
Here, we report safety and efficacy findings from the phase 2/3 part of a global phase 1/2/3 trial evaluating the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of 30 μg of BNT162b2 in preventing Covid-19 in persons 16 years of age or older. This data set and these trial results are the basis for an application for emergency use authorization.9 Col- lection of phase 2/3 data on vaccine immunoge- nicity and the durability of the immune response to immunization is ongoing, and those data are not reported here.</p>

<p>Trial Objectives, Participants and Oversight We assessed the safety and efficacy of two 30-μg doses of BNT162b2, administered intramuscu-
 
larly 21 days apart, as compared with placebo. Adults 16 years of age or older who were healthy or had stable chronic medical conditions, includ- ing but not limited to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus, or hepatitis C vi- rus infection, were eligible for participation in the trial. Key exclusion criteria included a medi- cal history of Covid-19, treatment with immuno- suppressive therapy, or diagnosis with an im- munocompromising condition.
Pfizer was responsible for the design and conduct of the trial, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, and the writing of the manuscript. BioNTech was the sponsor of the trial, manufactured the BNT162b2 clinical trial material, and contributed to the interpretation of the data and the writing of the manuscript. All the trial data were available to all the authors, who vouch for its accuracy and completeness and for adherence of the trial to the protocol, which is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. An independent data and safety mon- itoring board reviewed efficacy and unblinded safety data.</p>

<h1>Trial Procedures</h1>
<p>With the use of an interactive Web-based sys- tem, participants in the trial were randomly as- signed in a 1:1 ratio to receive 30 μg of BNT162b2 (0.3 ml volume per dose) or saline placebo. Participants received two injections, 21 days apart, of either BNT162b2 or placebo, deliv- ered in the deltoid muscle. Site staff who were responsible for safety evaluation and were un- aware of group assignments observed partici- pants for 30 minutes after vaccination for any acute reactions.</p>

<h2>Safety</h2>
<p>The primary end points of this trial were solic- ited, specific local or systemic adverse events and use of antipyretic or pain medication within 7 days after the receipt of each dose of vaccine or placebo, as prompted by and recorded in an electronic diary in a subset of participants (the reactogenicity subset), and unsolicited adverse events (those reported by the participants with- out prompts from the electronic diary) through 1 month after the second dose and unsolicited serious adverse events through 6 months after the second dose. Adverse event data through ap- proximately 14 weeks after the second dose are included in this report. In this report, safety</p>
